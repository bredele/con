# con

  > JSON in your console

 Con is a french bad word but it's also a cli to manipulate JSON directly from your console. 


## Installation

 Install with [nodejs](http://nodejs.org):

    $ npm install -g con

## Usage

 ```
Usage: con [<file>]

Examples:

  # get name attribute:
  $ con file.json get name

  # set name attribute:
  $ con file.json set name bredele

  # enable awesome attribute:
  $ con file.json enable awesome

  # disable awesome attribute:
  $ con file.json disable awesome

  # bump version
  $ con file.json bump
  
```

If `file` is not specified, con will automatically look for `component.json`, `bower.json` and `package.json` and apply the command. Here's an example:

```
  con bump 0.2.0
```

### Bump

 Con use [node-semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver), the semantic versioner of npm. You also can use [bump](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/bump) if you just need to bump the version of your files.

minor:
```
  con file.json bump minor
```

major:
```
  con file.json bump major
```

patch:
```
  con file.json bump patch
```

prerelease:
```
  con file.json bump patch
```
